### Section A: MCQ/True-False

1. **A** - Representational State Transfer
2. **B** - POST (used to create new resources)
3. **B** - False (Serializers can both serialize AND deserialize data)
4. **B** - Add 'rest_framework' to INSTALLED_APPS
5. **C** - ModelViewSet (provides list, create, retrieve, update, destroy)
6. **B** - 201 Created

### Section B: Coding

**Question 7:**
```python
class ArticleSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Article
        fields = '__all__'
```

**Question 8:**
```python
@api_view(['GET'])
def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    serializer = BookSerializer(books, many=True)
    return Response(serializer.data)
```

**Question 9:**
1. `GET /products/` - List all products
2. `POST /products/` - Create a product
3. `GET /products/{id}/` - Retrieve a product
4. `PUT /products/{id}/` - Update a product
5. `PATCH /products/{id}/` - Partial update
6. `DELETE /products/{id}/` - Delete a product

(Any 4 of these for full credit)

**Question 10:**
Sample Answer:
"A `Serializer` requires you to manually define all fields and implement `create()` and `update()` methods yourself. A `ModelSerializer` automatically generates fields from your Django model and provides default implementations of `create()` and `update()`. Use `Serializer` when working with non-model data or when you need complete custom control. Use `ModelSerializer` for most cases where you're serializing Django models, as it reduces boilerplate code significantly."
